        <h1 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-center text-blue-700">Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p class="mb-4 text-sm sm:text-base">
            This Privacy Policy explains how Cooper Alexander D'Andilly ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects information when you use our application at this bus stop location.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-6 text-blue-600">Information We Collect</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-sm sm:text-base">
            When you use Cooper Alexander D'andilly, the primary information we collect is the **destination address** you input to search for ride options.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-sm sm:text-base">
            We do **not** collect personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, phone number, or precise location data beyond the destination you provide and the static location of this bus stop.
        </p>
         <p class="mb-4 text-sm sm:text-base">
            If you choose a payment method (Card/NFC), this selection is processed to facilitate the ride booking process via the respective ride service API. We do **not** store your full payment card details or process financial transactions directly on this display unit. Card/NFC payments are handled securely via integrated payment gateways, and cash options are managed directly with the cab service.
        </p>


        <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-6 text-blue-600">How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-sm sm:text-base">
            The destination address you provide is used solely to:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4 text-sm sm:text-base">
            <li>Fetch estimated ride prices and times from various ride-sharing and cab service APIs (like Uber, Didi, and local cabs).</li>
            <li>Sort and display these options to you based on price and estimated time.</li>
            <li>Facilitate the booking process by passing the destination and payment preference to the selected ride service's API.</li>
        </ul>
         <p class="mb-4 text-sm sm:text-base">
            We may use aggregated, anonymized data (e.g., popular destinations searched from this location) for analytical purposes to improve the service, but this data will not be linked to any individual user or specific search.
        </p>


        <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-6 text-blue-600">Information Sharing</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-sm sm:text-base">
            We share the destination address and the bus stop's location with the ride-sharing and cab service APIs (Uber, Didi, etc.) for the sole purpose of obtaining ride estimates and facilitating a booking if you choose one.
        </p>
         <p class="mb-4 text-sm sm:text-base">
            We do **not** share your destination searches or any other information with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.
        </p>
         <p class="mb-4 text-sm sm:text-base">
            When you select a payment method and proceed to book, necessary information related to the booking (which may include origin, destination, and payment preference type - but **not** sensitive payment details) is passed to the selected ride service's API as required by their booking process. Their own privacy policies will govern how they handle that information.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-6 text-blue-600">Data Security</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-sm sm:text-base">
            We implement reasonable security measures to protect the limited data we handle (primarily destination addresses during the search process). However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.
        </p>
         <p class="mb-4 text-sm sm:text-base">
            As sensitive payment information is handled by secure, integrated payment gateways and not stored on this device, this reduces the risk associated with financial data.
        </p>


        <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-6 text-blue-600">Data Retention</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-sm sm:text-base">
            Destination addresses entered into the display unit are typically not stored long-term. They are processed in real-time to fetch ride estimates and are not retained after the user session on the display unit ends.
        </p>
         <p class="mb-4 text-sm sm:text-base">
            Aggregated, anonymized usage data may be retained for longer periods for service improvement, but this data cannot be used to identify you.
        </p>

         <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-6 text-blue-600">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-sm sm:text-base">
            We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
        </p>
